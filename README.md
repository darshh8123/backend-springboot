# Backend-springboot

Explored how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API using Spring Boot — one of the most powerful Java frameworks for developing enterprise-level web applications. Here are some key takeaways:

Spring Boot – Simplifies Java backend setup with auto-configuration.
REST Controller – Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
CRUD Operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete for User entity.
Service Layer – Contains business logic, separates concerns.
Repository Layer – Uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.
Annotations – @RestController, @RequestMapping, @Autowired, @Entity, @Id, etc.

 Used IntelliJ for development, Spring Boot to build the REST API, and Postman to test all the endpoints.”
